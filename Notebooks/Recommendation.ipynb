    "## Business Understanding \n",
    "\n",
    "Recommendation systems play a crucial role in modern digital platforms by enhancing user experience through personalized suggestions. Businesses across e-commerce, streaming services, social media, and news platforms depend on these systems to increase user engagement, improve satisfaction, and boost revenue. However, ensuring accuracy, diversity, and real-time performance remains a challenge, especially when dealing with large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business Objectives\n",
    "- Improve user engagement by providing relevant product recommendations.\n",
    "- Increase sales by recommending items customers are likely to purchase.\n",
    "- Enhance customer retention through personalized suggestions.\n",
    "- Reduce bounce rates by helping users discover desired products faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Implement a robust recommendation system that delivers relevant suggestions in real-time.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Improve user engagement metrics such as time spent on the platform and click-through rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Increase conversion rates through effective personalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Ensure fair and diverse recommendations to cater to different user preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Optimize computational efficiency to handle large datasets with minimal latency.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Many customers leave the platform without making a purchase due to difficulty in discovering relevant products. The goal is to develop a recommendation system that suggests products based on user interactions and product characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stakeholders\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Stakeholders\n",
    "- Business Owners: Want to increase revenue through better product discovery.\n",
    "- Marketing Team: Seeks insights into customer behavior and purchasing patterns.\n",
    "- Data Science Team: Responsible for building,training and optimizing the recommendation system.\n",
    "- Software Engineers: Implement the system into existing platforms ensuring seamless integration.\n",
    "- Users (customers): The end users who interact with recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features of the Recommendation System\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains the following key files:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. df_events: (User interactions with products)\n",
    "2. df_category_tree: (Product categories and hierarchy)\n",
    "3. df_items: (Product properties like price, availability, and brand)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "1. User ID: Unique identifier for each customer.\n",
    "2. Item ID: Unique identifier for each product.\n",
    "3. Event Type: Clicks, views, add-to-cart, purchases, etc.\n",
    "4. Timestamp: Time of interaction.\n",
    "5. Category ID: The category a product belongs to.\n",
    "6. Price: The cost of a product.\n",
    "7. Brand: The brand of a product.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Customers who add items to their cart are more likely to purchase them.\n",
    "2. Higher-priced items receive fewer clicks than lower-priced items.\n",
    "3. Users interact more frequently with items from popular brands.\n",
    "4. Certain categories receive more engagement than others.\n",
    "5. Customers are more likely to purchase after viewing an item multiple times.\n",
    "6. Purchasing behavior varies across different times of the day.\n",
    "7. Users who buy one item from a brand are more likely to buy another from the same brand.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analytical Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What are the most frequently purchased/viewed items by different user segments?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. How does user behavior change over time, and how does it impact recommendation accuracy?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What is the impact of diversity in recommendations on user engagement and satisfaction?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. How do collaborative filtering and content-based filtering compare in terms of recommendation performance?\n",
    "\n",
    "5. What is the relationship between recommendation relevance and user retention?\n",
    "\n",
    "6. How does the recommendation system handle cold-start users with minimal interaction history?\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What are the computational trade-offs between real-time and batch processing in recommendation systems?\n",
    "\n",
